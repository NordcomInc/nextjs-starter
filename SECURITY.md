# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We don't offer any support and take no form of liability in a legal sense, however
you can reasonably view the `master` branch (provided it's been updated somewhat
recently by something other than a bot like `@renvoate`) as the "supported" version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

While this project is only meant to serve as a mere template/guidelines for how you
can start a nextjs project based on how we do it; we still take all security issues
and vulnerabilities extremely seriously. Please report any (suspected) security
vulnerabilities and/or issues to **[opensource@nordcom.io](mailto:opensource@nordcom.io)**.
After which you will hear from one of us as soon as humanly possible. Thank you.

## Questions

For any questions or need for clarification feel to reach out to us on
