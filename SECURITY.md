## Security

Nordcom Group Inc. takes the security of our software very seriously. Although, due to our size and being such a new and novel company, we do not accept and cannot offer any form of liability (legal or otherwise) as per the included license unless otherwise expressly specified.

If you believe you have found a security flaw or vulnerability, please report it to us in the manner that is described below.

## Reporting Security Concerns and Issues

**Please, do not report or disclose a potential security vulnerability through a publicly accessible forum like GitHub issues.**Â 

Instead, report any suspected security vulnerabilities and/or issues to **[opensource@nordcom.io](mailto:opensource@nordcom.io)**.

After which, we may reach out and request more information to help us triage faster.

You will then either hear from one of us as soon as a fix has been deployed, if possible, or in the form of a public disclosure with a workaround.

## Questions

For any questions or need for clarification, feel free to reach out to us on
[opensource@nordcom.io](mailto:opensource@nordcom.io) or [X / (Twitter)](https://x.com/NordcomInc).

## Policy
